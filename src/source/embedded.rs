/// A [`Source`] which is embedded in the binary.
///
/// It can be created using a [`RawEmbedded`] struct.
///
/// ## Pros and Cons
///
/// Embedding assets enables to easily share a program as a single binary, which
/// is especially useful for WebAssembly, where no file system is available.
/// Moreover, you might experience performance gain, as no I/O is necessary to
/// load an asset.
///
/// However, embedding assets comes with a great cost. It can really slow
/// development speed, because it significantly increases compile time and it
/// makes it hard to edit external files (you have to recompile the program
/// each time you edit an asset). Hot-reloading is of course impossible. For
/// these reasons, you should only use this source for release builds. It also
/// tends to creates large binaries, which increases memory usage.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```no_run
/// use assets_manager::{AssetCache, source::{embed, Embedded}};
///
/// let embed = Embedded::from(embed!("assets"));
/// let cache = AssetCache::with_source(embed);
/// ```
